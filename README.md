# HERE-THE-LIVE-STREAM-Borussia-Dortmund-VS-Barcelona-UEFA-


The first leg tie that saw Borussia Dortmund face FC Barcelona has already taken place today, 14 April 2025, in the UEFA Champions League Quarter Finals. Having won on home turf in the long run, Barcelona beats Dortmund with a 0-4 at Estadi Olímpic Lluís Companys on 9 April 2025. ​
The return match will be held on April 15, 2025, at Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund. The aggregate score of Ajax over Dortmund is 4-0, which means that Dortmund needs to win by at least 5 goals to advance. ​
Here are the key developments ahead of the second leg:
Injuries: The Borussia Dortmund central defender Nico Schlotterbeck is out for the season with a torn meniscus, a significant loss for Dortmund’s defense. Balde, who has been playing on Barcelona's left flank, suffered a hamstring injury than could keep him on the sideline for up to three weeks, allowing him to also miss the Champions League tie, for example. ​
Suspension Watch: Barcelona’s Iñigo Martínez is one yellow card away from a suspension that would rule him out of the semi-finals. This disciplinary issue could impact his play time next match. ​
Match Details:
When: April 15th, 2025, 9pm CET (12pm PT / 3pm ET) ​
Where: Signal Iduna Park, Dortmund, Germany. ​
TV: In the U.S., the match will be broadcast on CBS Sports Network and streamed on Paramount+. In Spain, it is available to DAZN subscribers. Bangladesh: Coverage likely on local broadcasters or streaming platforms; check local listings. ​
So Borussia Dortmund going out to Barcelona would involve the impossible. But a response is what Dortmund will be hoping for following that 3-0 loss with eyes all around the globe firmly planted on whether they can do it or if it will be Barcelona joining Cornellà in the semi-finals.
Team Form
Barcelona: 2025; undefeated all competitions (19 wins, four draws) Now they are in first place in La Liga and favorites to win the Champions League.
Borussia Dortmund: Haphazard in the Bundesliga, sitting eighth. They eked out a 2-2 draw at Bayern Munich over the weekend but have work to do in Europe.
Probable Lineups
Borussia Dortmund:
Kobel; Ryerson, Can, Anton, Bensebaini; Gross, Nmecha; Gittens, Brandt, Adeyemi; Guirassy
Barcelona:
Szczesny; Kounde, Araujo, Cubarsi, Martin; Pedri, De Jong; Yamal, Lopez, Raphinha; Lewandowski.
Key Stats
Barça are unbeaten in six previous UEFA competition meetings with Borussia Dortmund (W4 D2).
The only player aged 35 and over with more Champions League goals is Robert Lewandowski (14).
Before he turns 18, Lamine Yamal becomes the youngest ever footballer to score four goals in Champions League.
Match Outlook
Dortmund falters, then must reach for a superhuman performance if it is to cross the finish line. An early goal would swing the momentum their way but going past a tight Barcelona backline will not be easy. Barcelona, on the other hand, while will be able to both rotate their side and fall in line with the high pressing high attacking game they play, should qualify for the semi-finals without faltering.

With Barcelona’s form and aggregate advantage:
Most Likely Outcome: Barcelona win or draw.
